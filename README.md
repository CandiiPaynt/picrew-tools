# picrew-tools

This is a collection of scripts built for understanding and retrieving data from Picrew image makers.

## Why?

I wrote the first version of this because one of the Picrew makers I was using didn't have an option for a transparent background.
After figuring out how the site stores your config in localStorage and how the CDN works, I was able to write a script that fetched all the used image parts.
I was then able to reconstruct the completed image without the background.

Since then, I've been tinkering with the script to make it as straightforward as possible.
